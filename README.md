# TypeScript HTML5 Canvas Game Template

## What is it?

In theory it is small code-oriented framework for building html5 games.  
In fact it is just a beginning of that.

## Quick start

1. Install **node.js** with **npm**
1. Open your favourite terminal at project's root folder
1. ``` $ npm install ```
1. ``` $ npm run start ```
1. In order to get release build run ```$ npm run build``` and get minified and optimized build at **/dist** folder

**Develop**

1. Open your favourite IDE/editor. *I prefer Visual Studio Code.*
1. Open your favourite terminal at project's root folder
1. DEV: Develop!
1. In terminal run ```npm run start``` and watch the result in a browser
1. GOTO DEV; Project will be automatically rebuild and browser will automatically refresh the page on every file saved. *magic!*
