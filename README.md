# TypeScript HTML5 Canvas Game Template

In theory it is small code-oriented framework for building html5 games.  
In fact it is just a beginning of that.

## Roadmap

* WebGL Renderer (SUDDENLY!) — rewrite tinyglr graphics (https://github.com/perfectdaemon/tiny-glr) from opengl and free pascal into webgl and typescript
* 2d graphics - sprites, texts, etc
* some other infrastructure
* performance tests
* ...

## Quick start

**Build and run**

1. Install **node.js** with **npm**
1. Open your favourite terminal at project's root folder
1. ``` $ npm install ```
1. Run develop: ``` $ npm run start ```  
or
1. Get release: ```$ npm run build``` — makes minified and optimized build at **/dist** folder

**Develop**

1. Open your favourite IDE/editor. *I prefer Visual Studio Code.*
1. Open your favourite terminal at project's root folder
1. DEV: Develop!
1. In terminal run ```$ npm run start``` and watch the result in a browser
1. GOTO DEV; Project will be automatically rebuild and browser will automatically refresh the page on every file saved. *magic!*
